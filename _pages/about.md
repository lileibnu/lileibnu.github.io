I am an associate professor and master's supervisor in the Department of Information Management at the School of Government Management, Beijing Normal University. I received my PhD in Information Science from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China. I was also a joint PhD candidate between Nanjing University of Science and Technology and the University of Pittsburgh, USA, and a research assistant at the School of Information Technology and Mathematical Sciences, University of South Australia. I have published more than 50 publications, including JASIST, IPM, Aslib JIM, OIR, LHT, ASIS&T, JCDL, iConference, ISSI, etc. My research fields include information analysis, user information behavior, social computing, information quality evaluation, and social media. Currently, I am focusing on the application of large language models in user information behavior analysis and improving human-AI interaction effects.
